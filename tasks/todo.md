# Obsidian MCP Server - Development Tasks

## Current Status: ✅ COMPLETED - MCP Server Tool Decorator Error Fixed

## Problem
Server crashes on startup with:
```
AttributeError: 'Server' object has no attribute 'tool'
```
at line 76 in server.py when trying to use `@self.mcp.tool()` decorator.

## Root Cause
- Code is written for **FastMCP** API (provides `@server.tool()` decorator)
- Dependencies only include `mcp>=1.0.0` (standard MCP SDK - no decorator support)
- README says "Built with FastMCP" but `fastmcp` package is not in dependencies
- The standard `mcp.server.Server` class doesn't have a `tool()` method

## Solution
Add FastMCP to dependencies and update imports to use it instead of the standard MCP SDK.

## Todo List

### Tasks
- [x] Add `fastmcp` to dependencies in pyproject.toml
- [x] Update imports in server.py to use FastMCP
- [x] Install the new dependency with `uv sync`
- [x] Test the server starts without errors

## Previous Work: ✅ COMPLETED - Build Error Fixed

### Problem
Build was failing with UTF-8 decode error at position 246 in README.md due to malformed characters.

### Changes Made
- Fixed malformed emoji characters in README.md lines 7-16
- Replaced invalid UTF-8 sequences with proper emoji
- Verified build completes successfully with `uv sync`

## Review Section

### Changes Made

1. **Updated Dependencies** ([pyproject.toml:8](pyproject.toml#L8))
   - Replaced `mcp>=1.0.0` with `fastmcp>=0.1.0`
   - Installed FastMCP v2.13.0.1 along with 46 related packages

2. **Updated Imports** ([server.py:8](src/mcp_obsidian/server.py#L8))
   - Changed `from mcp.server import Server` to `from fastmcp import FastMCP`
   - Removed unused imports `from mcp.types import Tool, TextContent`

3. **Updated Server Initialization** ([server.py:65](src/mcp_obsidian/server.py#L65))
   - Changed `self.mcp = Server("obsidian-vault")` to `self.mcp = FastMCP("obsidian-vault")`

### Test Results
✅ Server starts successfully without errors
- All components initialized properly (VaultManager, SearchEngine, Auth, RateLimiter)
- FastMCP banner displayed confirming proper initialization
- Server running on STDIO transport
- All 13 tools registered successfully

### Impact
- **Build Status**: ✅ Working
- **Files Changed**: 2 files ([pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml), [server.py](src/mcp_obsidian/server.py))
- **Lines Changed**: 3 lines total
- **Approach**: Minimal changes - only dependency and import updates
- **Risk**: Zero - code was already written for FastMCP API

### Minor Issue Noticed
- Pydantic deprecation warning in [models.py:32](src/mcp_obsidian/models.py#L32) (not critical, doesn't affect functionality)

### Next Steps
The server is now fully operational:
1. ✅ Dependencies installed
2. ✅ Server starts without errors
3. Ready to use with MCP clients
4. Optional: Fix Pydantic deprecation warning in future update
